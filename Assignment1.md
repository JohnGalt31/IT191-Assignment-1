# IT191-Assignment-1

Three jobs I would be interested in immediately after graduation (links to job posting are at the end of the report):

1. IT Systems Analyst I for the Tatitlek Corporation/GeoNorth, LLC

2. Information & Cyber Security Analyst for Liberty Mutual Insurance

3. Systems Analyst I for Associated Banc-Corp

Three jobs I would be interested in 5 - 8 years after graduation (links to job posting are at the end of the report):

4. Secret Agent (Cyber Crime Devision) for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)

5. Cyber Threat Analyst for the Cetral Intelligence Agency (CIA)

6. Information Systems Security Officer Level 1 for Leidos

For every single one of the job postings I have listed, a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science is required. Therefore step one in obtaining any one of the listed jobs is to graduate and obtain my degree. Graduating with a high GPA and a clean transcript will help me when I am applying for jobs, so in the very short term, obtaining A’s in all of my classes are a must.

Many of the jobs postings I listed require good social skills in a professional and team environment. These skills are obtained by experience, and a great way to get that experience is through an internship. I plan to get accepted into an internship program with the CIA or NSA this upcoming summer.

All of the jobs I listed that I would want five to eight years after graduation require a Top Secret security clearance. This would require me to abstain from any activity that would prevent me from obtaining this clearance, such as committing a felony. These jobs also require extensive testing in my subject of mastery, which would be data security, computer architecture, data structures, and knowledge of Java, C++, and HTML. In order for me to pass these tests, I will need to stay informed about all of these topics as well as maintain coding projects in order to retain my knowledge of programming languages and data structures. Thoroughly studying my textbooks prior to the interview and tests will prove prudent as well. 

Another requirement that would deem necessary is experience in a related field. This means I will possibly work a job I’m not happy at for a long enough time to have the experience to move to a different job. Regardless, I will need to start out in an entry-level job until I have the experience to be accepted for a higher-level position. 

In order to obtain any of these jobs, I will need to refine and perfect my interviewing skills. This can be done by taking advantage of the resource of this class, which is designed to give all the information necessary to do very well in a job interview. Practicing my interview with classmates as well as looking up common interview questions for the position are also ways that I can perfect my interviewing skills.

In summary: I will need as minimum a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science with a high GPA in my transcript, good social skills, and the ability to perform well during an interview. After some time, I will need experience in a related field, a Top Secret security clearance, and extensive knowledge of my subject of mastery.
